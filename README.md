# Pause

As a Full Stack Developer proficient in MERN stack technologies, I have successfully built a web application called "Pause" using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. With expertise in both frontend and backend development, I implemented a user-friendly and responsive interface with seamless functionality.

The "Pause" app allows users to share and view interesting events from their lives on a social media platform. From start to finish, I worked on all aspects of the application, including designing and developing the user interface, implementing server-side logic, integrating with third-party APIs, and deploying the application to a cloud platform.

Utilizing my knowledge of MERN stack technologies, I ensured that the application was efficient, secure, and scalable. By utilizing React for the frontend and Node.js, Express, and MongoDB for the backend, I was able to build a dynamic, single-page application that provides a smooth user experience.

Overall, my experience in developing the "Pause" application showcases my ability to work with MERN stack technologies and build a functional and user-friendly web application from start to finish.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
