# CharlesTMS

As a proficient Full Stack Developer in MERN technologies, I've successfully created "CharlesTMS," a web app using React, Node.js, Express, and MongoDB. I expertly merged frontend and backend skills to design a user-friendly, responsive interface with seamless functionality.

"CharlesTMS" is a customized MERN stack TMS, optimizing goods flow, improving compliance, and streamlining shipment documentation. This involved crafting a responsive UI, coding server-side functions, integrating TriumphPay's external API, managing files adeptly, and deploying onto a cloud platform.

Leveraging MERN knowledge, I ensured an efficient, secure, and scalable app. Combining React frontend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB backend, I built a dynamic single-page app that guarantees a smooth user experience.

Overall, my "CharlesTMS" development underscores my MERN proficiency, showcasing my capacity to create a functional, user-friendly web app end to end.

Setup:
- run ```npm i && npm start``` for both client and server side to start the app
